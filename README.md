# WiredSwift

WiredSwift is an implementation of the Wired 2.0 protocol written in Swift. 

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/nark/WiredSwift/workflows/Swift/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nark/WiredSwift/actions)


## Requirements

* macOS 10.14
* iOS 12
* Xcode 

## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed by Swift Package Manager, have a look to the [Package.swif](https://github.com/nark/WiredSwift/blob/master/Package.swift) file for details. 

## Getting Started

### Adding to your project

Latest release version:

    .package(name: "WiredSwift", url: "https://github.com/nark/WiredSwift", from: "1.0.6")

Latest upstream version:

    .package(name: "WiredSwift", url: "https://github.com/nark/WiredSwift", .branch("master"))
    
### Connection

Minimal connection to a Wired 2.0 server:

    let specUrl = URL(string: "https://wired.read-write.fr/spec.xml")!
    let spec = P7Spec(withUrl: specUrl)

    // the Wired URL to connect to
    let url = Url(withString: "wired://localhost:4871")

    // init connection
    let connection = Connection(withSpec: spec, delegate: self)
    connection.nick = "Me"
    connection.status = "Testing WiredSwift"

    // perform  connect
    if connection.connect(withUrl: url) {
        // connected
    } else {
        // not connected
        print(connection.socket.errors)
    }

### Join to the public chat

Once connected, in order to login into the public chat and list connected users, you have to explicitely trigger the `wired.chat.join_chat` transaction. The `Connection` class can help you by calling the following method:

    connection.joinChat(chatID: 1)
    
Where `1` is always the ID of the public chat regarding the Wired 2.0 protocol.

### Receive messages

While using interactive mode, you have to comply with the `ConnectionDelegate` protocol to receive messages (`P7Message`) or any other events from the initiated connection. For example, the `connectionDidSendMessage(connection: Connection, message: P7Message)` method will distribute received messages which you can handle as the following:

    extension Controller: ConnectionDelegate {
        func connectionDidReceiveMessage(connection: Connection, message: P7Message) {
            if  message.name == "wired.chat.user_list" {
                print(message.xml())
            }
        }
        
        func connectionDidReceiveError(connection: Connection, message: P7Message) {
            if let specError = spec.error(forMessage: message), let errorMessage = specError.name {
                print(errorMessage)
            }
        }
    }
    
### Send messages

The following example illustrate how to send a message:

    let message = P7Message(withName: "wired.chat.say", spec: spec)
    message!.addParameter(field: "wired.chat.id", value: 1) // public chat ID
    message!.addParameter(field: "wired.chat.say", value: "Hello, world!")
    
    self.connection.send(message: message!)
    
To learn more about the Wired 2.0 specification you can visit this documentation: [http://wired.read-write.fr/spec.html](http://wired.read-write.fr/spec.html) and read the orginal code of the `libwired` C library: [https://github.com/nark/libwired](https://github.com/nark/libwired)

### Interactive socket

The `Connection` class provides two ways of handling messages:

* connection instance is set as `interactive` so it will automatically manage a listening loop in a separated thread and dispatch receive message through `ConnectionDelegate` protocol to registered delegates in the main thread. This is the default behavior.
* connection instance is NOT `interactive`, and in that case you have to handle every message read/write transactions by yourself using `Connection.readMessage()` and `Connection.sendMessage()` methods. This for example is used for transfers separated connections that have different behaviors.

Set the `interactive` attribute to `false` before calling `Connection.connect()` if you want to use uninteractive mode.

### Client Info Delegate

The `Connection` class provides the `ClientInfoDelegate` to return custom values for `wired.info.application.name`, `wired.info.application.version` and `wired.info.application.build` of the `wired.client_info` message. 

    extension Controller: ClientInfoDelegate {
        func clientInfoApplicationName(for connection: Connection) -> String? {
            return "My Swift Client"
        }

        func clientInfoApplicationVersion(for connection: Connection) -> String? {
            return "1.0"
        }

        func clientInfoApplicationBuild(for connection: Connection) -> String? {
            return "99"
        }
    }
    
### BlockConnection

WiredSwift provides a `BlockConnection` class which instead of using delegate, uses Swift completion closure, combined with Wired 2.0 transaction (`wired.transaction`). Each message sent using this class is flagged with an incremental transaction number in the `wired.transaction` field. Each response to this relative message sent by the server will also provide the same transaction number in the `wired.transaction` field. This way, the `BlockConnection` class can internally match responses with completion closure as callbacks.

    let connection = BlockConnection(withSpec: spec, delegate: self)

    if connection.connect(withUrl: serverURL) {
        let message = P7Message(withName: "wired.board.get_boards", spec: spec)
        
        connection.send(message: message, progressBlock: { (response) in            
            if response.name == "wired.board.board_list", let board = response.string(forField: "wired.board.board") {
                print(board)
            }
        }) { (response) in
            print("Board loading done.")
        }            
    }

### Logger

You can configure the `Logger` class of WiredSwift as follow:

    // set the max vele severity
    Logger.setMaxLevel(.ERROR)
    
    // completely remove STDOUT console output
    Logger.removeDestination(.Stdout)

## Contribute

You are welcome to contribute using issues and pull-requests if you want to.

Focus is on:

* socket IO stability: the quality of in/out data interpretation and management through the Wired socket
* mutli-threading stability: the ability to interact smoothly between connections and UIs
* low-level unit tests: provides a strong implementation to enforce the integrity of the specification
* specification compliance: any not yet implemented features that require kilometers of code…
* limit regression from the original implementation
